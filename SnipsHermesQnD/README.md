# SnipsHermesQnD

This is a really "Quick-and-Dirty" implementation of an Julia-ecosystem for the
Snips.ai home assistant.

Aim is not yet a production system but testing ways to develop apps in the new and awesome programming
language Julia.

## Installation

The package builds on the mosquitto MQTT (`mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub`), which can be installed from the debian repos
(for Raspberry Pi: package `mosquitto` and `mosquitto-client`).

To install the Julia package, run

```Julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.clone("git@github.com:andreasdominik/SnipsHermesQnD.git")
```
