# 1) set LANG to "en", "de", "fr", etc.
# 2) link the Dict with messages to the version with

const LANG = Snips.getLanguage()

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING 3 LINES UNLESS YOU KNOW
# WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

# LANG in QnD(Snips) is defined from susi.toml or set
# to "en" if no susi.toml found.
# This will override LANG by config.ini if a key "language"
# is defined locally:
#
if Snips.isConfigValid(:language)
    Snips.setLanguage(Snips.getConfig(:language))
end
# or LANG can be set manually here:
# Snips.setLanguage("fr")
#

# Name of slots to be extracted from intents:

# name of entry in config.ini:

#
# link between actions and intents:
# intent is linked to action{Funktion}
# the action is only matched, if
#   * intentname matches and
#   * if the siteId matches, if site is  defined in config.ini
#     (such as: "switch TV in room abc").
