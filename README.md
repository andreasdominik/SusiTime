# SusiTime

A simple skill to tell the time for **Snips** and **Susi**, a
(Susi is no Snips)-framework to run Snips-skills without Snips
(esp. without the Snips console).

The skill is written in Julia with the SnipsHermesQnD framework.

 The full documentation is just work-in-progress!

# Julia

This skill is (like the entire SnipsHermesQnD framework) written in the
modern programming language Julia (because Julia is faster
then Python and coding is much much easier and much more straight forward).
However "Pythonians" often need some time to get familiar with Julia.
