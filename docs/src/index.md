# ADoSnipsTemplate

This is a template skill for the `SnipsHermesQnD` framework for Snips.ai
written in Julia.

To learn about Snips, goto [snips.ai](https://snips.ai/.)

To get introduced with Julia, see [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/.)


## Similariries and differences to the Hermes dialogue manager

The framework allows for setting up skills/apps the same way as
with the Python libraries. However, according to the more functional
programming style in Julia more direct interactions are provided.
As an example, the function `listenIntentsOneTime()` can be used
without a callback-function. Recognised intent and payload
are returned as function value.

On top of this, SnipsHermesQnD comes with simple question/answer method to
ask questions answered by *Yes* or *No*
(`askYesOrNo()` and `askYesOrNoOrUnknown()`).
As a result, it is possible to get a quick user-feedback without leaving
the control flow of a function, like illustrated in this skill action:

```Julia
"""
function destroyAction(topic, payload)

    Initialise self-destruction.
"""
function destroyAction(topic, payload)

  # log message:
  println("- ADoSnipsDestroyYourself: action destroyAction() started.")

  if askYesOrNo("Do you really want to initiate self-destruction?")
    Snips.publishEndSession("Self-destruction sequence started!")
    boom()
  else
    Snips.publishEndSession("""OK.
                            Self-destruction sequence is aborted!""")
  end

  return true
end
```
